# Virtual Machine

This project is a stack-based virtual machine for a custom language runtime.

This virtual machine contains the following features:
- an bytecode interpreter
- atomic reference counting (in place as the primary form of memory management differing from traditional mark-and-sweep garbage collection in the JVM and C# Runtime)
- a stack-based virtual machine
