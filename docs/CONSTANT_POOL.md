# Constant Pool

The constant pool is currently in development to keep track of string identifiers within the code.

The main purpose of the constant pool is to reduce memory overhead that occurs when keeping multiple copies of constants. Methods will use the vtable (virtual method table) classes once development is complete. This will allow code to be reference and support polymorphism and function overloading in the future.
