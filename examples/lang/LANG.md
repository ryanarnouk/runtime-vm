First example of an actual example of a language as I am working on beginning to parse it out and turn it into a binary as defined in the "new_draft" folder.

For sake of simplicity in this original version, the "standard library" (which currently only is standard out) will automatically be imported.
I'll create a better package/import management system in the future.
