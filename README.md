# Runtime VM

This proejct is inspired by the C# Runtime and Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It also draws on inspiration from Swift, C++, and Rust for basic memory management techniques.

This project is currently in development stages. But eventually, my hope is it to be a very basic rendition of a runtime and virtual machine that can run a simple language. It will not be fully-fledged out, but it will be a good starting point for me to learn about how these runtimes work.

More concretely, my goal is to be able to do simple Leetcode problems using this runtime and language.
