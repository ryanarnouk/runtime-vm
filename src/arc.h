// Note: for this project I am using Atomic Reference Counting for Garbage Collection
// This is in line more with Swift, Objective-C, and C++ Smart Pointer examples.
// Whereas, Java and C# tend to use algorithms like mark-and-sweep (which I may implement in the future)
// For sake of simplicity, I have implemented reference counting for this language
// This is the sole garbage collector
